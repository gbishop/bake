This loaf has glazed nuts added. I started with 75g of 50/50 pecan/walnuts and glazed them with 75g of brown sugar, 25g water and 1.0g salt in a non-stick pan. https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/quick-stovetop-candied-pecans/ I failed to weigh the result but it must have been about 150g.

This one turned out as good as the first. I think lowering the oats helps the texture.
