I used the bread machine to mix and knead it. The loaf turned out looking
pretty good with no tearing. I did used 25% bread flour, perhaps that helped.
The hydration seemed a little high; I think I need to reduce the hydration when
using bread flour.

The odd amount of bronze chief is because I was running out.

This tastes great but I did a terrible job incorporating the nuts resulting in
tunnels.
