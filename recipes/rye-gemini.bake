/*

1. Malt Scald
* Place red rye malt in a small heat-proof bowl.
* Pour boiling water over the malt. Stir until it forms a smooth, dark paste.
* Let it cool below 104F.

2. Mix
* In a large bowl, combine the malt paste, the warm water (95F), starter,
  molasses, and yeast. Whisk until dissolved.
* Add rye flour and salt.
* Mix for 5–7 minutes.

3. Panning
* Oil the pan and line with parchment paper.
* Pan the dough and pack it into the corners.
* Smooth the top flat.
* Sprinkle with rye flour.

4. Rise (about 3 hours)
* Cover the pan and place in a warm, draft-free spot (81F–86F is the "sweet spot").
* Monitor closely: It will move fast.
* The Goal: Bake when the center of the dough has risen to 1/2 inch below the rim
  and you see tiny "pinprick" bubbles on the surface.

5. Bake (about 1 hour)
* Preheat oven to 425F.
* If using the Pullman lid, slide it on now.
* Bake at 425F for 15 minutes. Lower to 400F and bake for another 45 minutes.
* Check: Take the loaf out of the pan and check the internal temperature.
  It must hit 208F.

6. Cooling
* Place on a wire rack immediately.
* Once room temperature, wrap in a linen cloth and wait 24 hours before slicing.
