/* Notes

Started about 8:00

Starter pH = 4.16

I increased the hydration by 10% and the dough was still quite
stiff. 

Into the pan about 9:10. I couldn't get the parchment paper to work
so I oiled the pan. It dropped right out when baked.

Use less yeast next time.

I forgot to dock it!

Baked near top of pan at 10:00. 15 minutes lid on, 45 lid off then
remove from pan and check internal temp.

200F inside after removing from pan after 45 minutes. Back into the
oven out of pan for 10 more.

I only reached 206F after 13 more minutes.

Gummy on and left a film on the knife. The rise was much too fast.

Michael likes the flavor! Hopefully some white rye and a longer
ferment will help.

/*

1. Malt Scald
* Place red rye malt in a small heat-proof bowl.
* Pour boiling water over the malt. Stir until it forms a smooth,
  dark paste.
* Let it cool below 104F.

2. Mix
* In a large bowl, combine the malt paste, the warm water (95F),
  starter, molasses, and yeast. Whisk until dissolved.
* Add rye flour and salt.
* Mix for 5–7 minutes.

3. Panning
* Oil the pan and line with parchment paper.
* Pan the dough and pack it into the corners.
* Smooth the top flat.
* Sprinkle with rye flour.

4. Rise (about 3 hours)
* Cover the pan and place in a warm, draft-free spot (81F–86F is
  the "sweet spot").
* Monitor closely: It will move fast.
* The Goal: Bake when the center of the dough has risen to
  1/2 inch below the rim and you see tiny "pinprick" bubbles on
  the surface.

5. Bake (about 1 hour)
* Preheat oven to 425F.
* If using the Pullman lid, slide it on now.
* Bake at 425F for 15 minutes. Lower to 400F and bake for another
  45 minutes.
* Check: Take the loaf out of the pan and check the internal
  temperature. It must hit 208F.

6. Cooling
* Place on a wire rack immediately.
* Once room temperature, wrap in a linen cloth and wait 24 hours
  before slicing.
