*Notes*

8:00 leaven into the SDH at 78F.
12:00 leaven is doubled, domed and bubbly.
12:08 mixed. Actual FDT=69F. Rest for 30 minutes.
12:40 S&F
13:18 S&F
13:50 S&F at just over 400mL
16:00 about 480mL
16:25 shaped, into pan, into fridge.
07:20 about 2 inches from the top of the pan, baking anyway
07:45 into the oven lid on at 400F convection
08:15 remove lid, temp down to 350F convection
08:35 out of oven, internal 205F

About 1/2 inch short of the top of the pan. This was plenty of
flour to completely fill the pan. 

Nicely sour, too dense. A good start.

Possible changes:
* add VWG?
* more kneading?
* DT was 69F at beginning of bulk, should be 72F
* The SDH is a crappy proofing box, too little heat capacity.
* a little yeast?
* let it rise a bit before refrigerating?
* Maybe the 3 hour bulk should have been from mix? I don't know how
you measure 30% rise when there are S&F in there.

Method and Timeline

Step 1: Levain Preparation (Night Before)

Goal: Build a warm, active, high-hydration levain to maximize lactic
acid content upon mixing.

Action: Feed your whole wheat starter at 100% hydration (1:1:1 or
1:2:2 ratio).

Temperature: Let it ripen at a warm temperature (75F to 78F / 24C to
25.5C) until it is very active and bubbly (4–6 hours). The levain is
ready when it is dome-shaped, bubbly, and passes the float test (4–6
hours).

Step 2: Mixing and Autolyse Protection

Goal: Mix all ingredients immediately to activate the protease
inhibitors (salt, yogurt) and protector (oil).

Mixing: Mix the cold water with the salt, honey, olive oil, and
yogurt. Add the flour blend and the ripe levain. Mix until a shaggy
mass forms.

Rest: Cover and rest for 30 minutes.

FDT Target: Aim for a Final Dough Temperature (FDT) around 72F (22C).

Step 3: Bulk Fermentation (Warm & Controlled)

Goal: Push the temperature and time to generate lactic acid while
protecting the gluten.

Ambient Temp: Place the dough in a warm environment: 75F to 78F (24C
to 25.5C).

Folds: Perform 3 sets of coil folds or gentle stretch-and-folds
during the first 90 minutes.

Timing: Total Bulk Fermentation: 3 to 3.5 hours (Approximate).

CRITICAL Indicator: Stop bulk fermentation when the dough has
increased in volume by 30% to 40% and passes the finger-poke test
(springs back slowly, leaving a small dent).

Step 4: Shaping and Cold Proofing

Goal: Set the final shape and stop enzyme activity.

Action: Shape the dough gently into a tight log and place it
seam-down in the oiled Pullman pan.

Proofing: Cover the pan (or put the lid on) and place it immediately
into the refrigerator (38F to 40F / 3C to 4C).

Duration: Cold Proof for 8 to 16 hours.

Check: The dough should rise to 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 4cm) below
the top rim of the pan.

Step 5: Baking

Preheat: Preheat oven to 425F (218 C)

Cold Bake: Place the cold pan (with the lid on) into the preheated
oven.

Bake Time:

30–35 minutes with the lid on.

Reduce heat to 375F (190C), remove the lid, and continue baking for
another 15–25 minutes.

Doneness: Pull the loaf when the internal temperature reaches 205F
to 210F (96C to 99C).

Cooling: Immediately remove the loaf from the pan and cool
completely on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing.
