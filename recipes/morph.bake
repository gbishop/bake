Scaled to my 2.3L pullman pan.

Mixed the sponge using rolled oats and king arthur whole wheat flour at 19:40
and put it in the 94F SDH.

Sponge pH at 8:04 is 3.97 the temperature was 85. It has increased about 30%
overnight and the top is flat. The SDH only managed 88.6 at the top of the
container. Room temperature got down to 63 overnight.

I ran the bread machine dough cycle. Started at 8:14. Stopped after 5 minutes
and set the timer to start in 30 minutes. The pan with paddle weighs 404g.

I lost track of time in here because I was working on knots

Out of the BM at ?, pH is ?, dT is ?.

Into the oven with the light on at ?. pH is ? dt is ?

Baked at 1:30 about 1 inch above the top of the pan in 350F oven.
pH is 4.62 and dT is 82F.

Removed after 45 minutes, 197F inside. Out at 12:12

Looks good.

Good flavor and texture. I like this flavor better I think.
