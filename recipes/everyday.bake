July 27, 2025

Changes
* program the bm to reproduce timing
* add barley, kamut, and buckwheat to use them up

Zoji pan weighs 773g

starter pH is ?

I started about 12:45

Used the BM for kneading only. Removed the dough to the cambro and
into the oven on proof. Let it rise twice. Then into the pan.

19:25 bake in 325F preheated convection oven 45 minutes lid on.

Baked a little early because it was getting late considering time to
bake and cool.

Looks good, barely filled the pan

Good flavor. Clearly more acidic.
