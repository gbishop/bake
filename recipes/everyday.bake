Changes
* Adding barley and buckwheat
* Drop walnuts

Zoji pan weighs 773g

starter pH is ?

I started about 8:00. Started BM at 8:15.

I added all the ingredients to the pan. Started the dough cycle with
preheat turned off. Let it run for a couple of minutes until the
ingredients were incorporated. Reset it, turned preheat on, and
started it again. The preheat period serves at autolyse.

10:13 final rise begins.

11:45 bake in 325F preheated convection oven 45 minutes lid on.

Looks good, filled the pan with rounded corners which I think is
ideal.

Good flavor. I may be able to taste a difference.
