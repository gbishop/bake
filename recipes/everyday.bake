Changes
* Starter now 100% hydration
* Bake when dough is 3/4 inch from the top of the pan.

Zoji pan weighs 773g

? starter pH is ?

I started about 10:35.

I mixed the wet ingredients with the immersion blender before adding
them to the pan. I lost 4 grams in the process and made it up with
water.

I added all the ingredients to the pan. Started the dough cycle with
preheat turned off. Let it run for a couple of minutes until the
ingredients were incorporated. Reset it, turned preheat on, and
started it again. The preheat period serves at autolyse.

12:45 into pan. Rise using proof mode. Dough is easy to handle, not
sticky.

14:00 bake in 325F preheated convection oven 45 minutes lid on.

Filled the pan perfectly. Not even a tiny bit of overflow. The
internal T was 210. It could have come out a bit sooner.

It looks perfect.

Flavor is good.
