/* Sour prep

• Completely dissolve the active starter culture in the warm water.

• Add the rye wholemeal flour and mix thoroughly until no dry clumps
  remain.

• Cover the mixture and allow it to ripen at room temperature for
  the time specified by the formulation (approximately 15 hours).

dough:
  sour
  rye_whole = 20%
  rye_white = 38%
  water_95F_104F
  salt = 2.50%
  yeast = 0.30%
  hydration = 75%

  # total_flour = 1000g
  total = 1500g

/* Dough mixing

• Initial Slurry: Place the warm water (35-40°C) and the ripe
  sourdough starter into the mixer bowl. Using a rubber paddle
  attachment, mix on low speed for 40-50 seconds until the starter
  is dissolved and the mixture is homogenous. This slurrying step
  is significantly faster and more effective with a paddle than
  a traditional dough hook.

• Adding Dry Ingredients: Add the rye flour, salt, yeast and any
  optional spices (such as bread spice) to the bowl.

• Final Mix: Mix on a slow speed for approximately 3.5 minutes. The
  goal is simply to combine all ingredients into a uniform,
  paste-like mass. Warning: Avoid over-mixing. Extended mixing will
  cause the rye dough to lose stability and become progressively
  stickier and more difficult to handle.

• Assessing Consistency: The target consistency of the dough should
  be similar to that of silicone caulk—smooth, creamy, and
  paste-like. To check the firmness without the dough sticking, use
  wet hands to gently press or pat the surface. Note that the water
  in the recipe is a starting point. As demonstrated in the source
  video, master baker Kappl adds a significant amount of additional
  water by feel in sips to achieve the correct paste-like
  consistency, especially when using wholemeal flour in the starter,
  which has a higher water absorption.

/* Rest

• Cover the mixing bowl containing the freshly mixed dough.

• Allow the dough to rest for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature.

• Line the pan.

• Caution: Do not extend this time significantly. A longer bulk rest
  can weaken the dough structure, making the subsequent transfer
  more difficult and potentially compromising the final loaf's
  volume.

*/

/* Panning and proofing

Transfer to the lined pan, cover and let rest for 25 to 40 minutes
at RT.

Signs of Readiness: The dough is ready for the oven when it has
reached full proof. Assess this using the following
indicators:

• Visual Cues: The surface of the dough will show small, fine cracks
  and visible signs of aeration.

• The Two-Finger Test: Gently press the dough with two fingers. If
  the indentation springs back very slowly but remains slightly
  visible, the dough is perfectly proofed. If the indentation
  springs back completely and quickly, it is under-proofed. If it
  does not spring back at all or collapses, it is over-proofed.

*/

/* Baking

• Preheat to 450F. Bake for 10 minutes covered, then
  remove the cover and reduce temperature to 350F for 50 minutes.
  Internal temperature should be > 205F.

• Preheating: For the best results, you should use a preheated pot
  in a preheated oven. If you are making a wholemeal version of the
  bread, the sources note that you can also place the dough into
  a cold pot and then put it into the hot oven.

• Proofing: You can perform the final proofing directly in
  a greased cast-iron loaf pan or proof it in a basket and then
  carefully tip the dough into a preheated pot.

• The Lid Timing: To prevent the crust from tearing too deeply or
  becoming too thick, the expert recommends removing the lid after
  10 to 12 minutes. This allows the steam to escape so the crust can
  become crispy and brown properly for the remainder of the
  60-minute bake time.

• Achieving the Right Proof: If the bread cracks too deeply when
  baking in a pot, it is often a sign of under-proofing. Ensure the
  dough has reached full proof where a finger indentation stays
  visible and only bounces back slightly—before putting it in the
  pot

/* Notes
18 January 2026

• Mixed the sour about 17:00 using the paddle in the KA. Covered the
  bowl and put it in the proofer at 72F to mirror his RT.

• Mixed the dry ingredients for the dough.

Next morning.

• Mixed in the KA, it was a mess. 

• I added 10% more water.

• I had a hard tine lining the pan but it was fairly easy to move it
  by hand into the pan.

• I'm letting it proof at 80F. 40 minutes was not enough. I'm
  waiting for cracks and tiny holes.

• At 10:30 it has clearly risen so I preheated the oven to 450.

• Baked at 10:50 with 3 tiny holes. It had risen to nearly the top
  of the pan. 

• Only 185F after 65 minutes. I gave it 15 more and it reached 206F.
  I think Dietmar would suggest that my baking temperature should
  have been higher.

• It is cracked around the top mostly because of the parchment paper
  curling inward at the top.

• I forgot to wrap it in cloth.

Otherwise it looks really good. 5 inches tall and nicely rounded.
