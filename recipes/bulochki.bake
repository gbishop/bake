This hydration seems much more reasonable at 63% and I like
the apple filling from here:
https://www.olgasflavorfactory.com/olgastips/kitchen-tips/apple-filling/

As written:

2/3 cup warm milk (105â€“115 degrees Fahrenheit)
2 teaspoons  dry yeast
3 Tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 cup or 8 Tablespoons butter, melted and slightly cooled
2 eggs, lightly beaten (for the dough)
3 cups all purpose flour

*/

dough:
  milk
  yeast = 1.67%
  sugar = 10%
  butter = 32%
  eggs = 28%
  flour = 100%
  salt = 2% - 1.3% * butter

  hydration = 63%
  total_flour = 360g
