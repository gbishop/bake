1 Add the egg, milk, sugar and yeast to a jug, and thoroughly mix,
set it aside for 10 minutes, until it activates.

2 Once activated, add the yeast mixture to your stand mixer bowl,
then add the oil or softened butter to the liquid in the bowl.

3 Add the flour, followed by the salt to the bowl, attach the dough
hook and knead for 10 minutes.

4 If you are kneading this recipe by hand, add all of the
ingredients to a large bowl and partially mix it all together, tip
it out onto your worktop and knead the dough for 10 minutes, then
carry on with recipe.

5 Turn out the dough from the mixer and form it into a ball, place
it into a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl and let it proof/rise
for 1 hour, the dough should at least, double in size (this may take
longer depending on the temperature of your kitchen) if you can,
proof your dough in the oven, with just the light bulb on.

6 When the time is up, turn out the now risen dough onto a non-
floured surface, and knock it back, give it a quick knead then form
it into a ball.

7 Divide the dough into 9 equal pieces about 76g each, for a more
uniform size and appearance try to use digital scales for dividing.

8 Roll each piece of dough into a ball, (see video for rolling
technique).

9 Cover the small dough balls with a lightweight dry cloth, let
them rest for 5 minutes.

10 When the rest period is up, using a rolling pin with the 4mm
spacer, roll each ball into 11cm / 4in circle, and place them on
lightly floured tray.

11 Once all are rolled out, cover them again and allow them to
proof/rise in a warm spot, for 20 minutes.

12 Take a large frying pan or griddle,( NO! oil,) heat it on
induction 4 until it is approx. 160°C / 320°F, 

13 Place 3 of the muffins in the hot pan, and cook for 3 minutes on
each side, once they are golden brown, risen and firm to the touch,
remove them from the pan. Cook them slowly so they get done inside.

14 Keep them on a warm plate, while you finish off the rest.

15 Storing suggestions, soon as they have cooled from the pan, these
can be frozen, you can take them out in the morning, defrost in the
microwave, cut in half, then toasted, resulting in, fresh muffins
for breakfast.
