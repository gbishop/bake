1)  develop the gluten before adding oil or butter
2)  give the dough two full rises in bulk instead of just the one
that is typical for straight dough pan loaves
3)  keep the dough cool to cold for the majority of fermentation (no
higher than 74F, and preferably lower).

Mix all except oil/butter
Rest 10-20 mins to hydrate
mix to good gluten development
Add oil /butter until incorporated
DDT 23 C

Bulk Fermentation Refrigerate 12 hours to at least double
 	
Remove from fridge Cool room temp, up to 2 hrs if needed
 	 	 	
Degas and fold

2nd rise Rise again 3 to 5 hours cool room temp. Should rise higher

Proofing device oiled loaf pan 21 x 11 x 7cm

Final Proof time Approximately 1.5 to 3 hours hour at 22C
 	
Oven type/temperature Conventional 190C Convection 177C
 	 	
Total bake 25-30 minutes
