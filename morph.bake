Scaled to my 2.3L pullman pan.

Mixed the sponge using rolled oats and king arthur whole wheat flour at 21:30
and put it in the 86F SDH.

Sponge pH at 9:00 is 4.05 the temperature was 78.
It has increased about 50% overnight and the top is flat.

I ran the bread machine dough cycle. Started at 9:20. Stopped after 5 minutes
and set the timer to start in 30 minutes.

pH after kneading is 5.21 and DT is 84F. I put the dough in the 2L cambro
and put it in the oven with the light on. Just under 1L. Into the oven about
10:30. Out at 12:15 it has risen to above 2L. pH is 4.96, dt is 80F.

Into the pan about about 12:25. 

Baked at 13:55 about 1/2 inch above the top of the pan in 350F oven. Removed
after 44 minutes, 202F inside. 

Good flavor and texture. This loaf is close to perfect!
